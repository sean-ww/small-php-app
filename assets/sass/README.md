How each folder works:
=======================

Base
--------------
The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project.
In there, you might find the reset (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some stuff dealing with typography, 
and, depending on the project, maybe some other files.
    _reset.scss or _normalize.scss
    _typography.scss


Components
--------------
For smaller components, there is the components/ folder (frequently called modules/).
While layout/ is kind of macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more micro.
It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything along those lines.
There are usually a lot of files in components/ since your site is should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
    _media.scss
    _carousel.scss
    _thumbnails.scss


Helpers
--------------
The helpers/ folder (sometimes called utils/) gathers all Sass tools and helpers we’ll use across the project.
Got a function? A mixin? Put it in there (see more on functions/mixins: http://thesassway.com/advanced/pure-sass-functions).
This folder also contains a _variables.scss file (sometimes _config.scss) 
which holds all global variables for the project (for typography, color schemes, and so on).
    _variables.scss
    _mixins.scss
    _functions.scss
    _placeholders.scss (frequently named _helpers.scss)


Layout
--------------
The layout/ directory (sometimes called partials/) usually contains a number of files, 
each of them setting some styles for the main sections of the layout (header, footer, and so on).
It also contains the _grid file which is the grid system used to build the layout.
    _grid.scss
    _header.scss
    _footer.scss
    _sidebar.scss
    _forms.scss


Pages
--------------
If you have page-specific styles, I think it’s cool to put them in a pages/ folder and in a file named 
after the page.For example, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page, 
so you’d have a _home.scss file in pages/ dealing with this.
    _home.scss
    _contact.scss

Depending on your deployment process, those files could be called on their own to avoid merging them with the others 
in the resulting stylesheet. It is really up to you. Where I work, we decided to make them not-partials in order to 
include them only on pages requiring them. For example, our home page has a very specific layout, compiling to about 
200 lines of CSS. To prevent those rules from being loaded on every page, we include this file only on the home page.


Themes
--------------
If you are working on a large site with multiple themes like I do, having a themes/ folder can make sense. You can 
stuff all your theme/design related styles in there. This is definitely project-specific so be sure to include it 
only if you feel the need.
    _theme.scss
    _admin.scss


Vendors
--------------
And last but not least, you will probably have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries 
and frameworks – Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same 
folder is a good way to tell “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.
    _bootstrap.scss
    _jquery-ui.scss
    _select2.scss
